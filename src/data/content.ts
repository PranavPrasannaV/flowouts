    body: `Hello! Glad you could make it to Flow. If you don't know already, Flow was originally Everwear but after a minor "rebrand", it is now Flow!
  
In full transparency, Flow is run by me, Suryansh. A teen who always wanted a brand that everyone bought and loved. The moment I discovered drop shipping, I didn't really do anything with it. But a few months later, I decided to give it a shot. And here we are now!
  
I hope you enjoy everything on this site. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at flow@flowouts.com.`,
