    body: `Hello! Glad you could make it to Flow.

If you don't know already, Flow was originally Everwear but after a minor "rebrand", it is now Flow! In full transparency, Flow is run by me, Suryansh. A teen who always wanted a brand that everyone bought and loved. The moment I discovered drop shipping, I didn't really do anything because nothing clicked for me. Then, the brand dream came back.

At around 13 years old, I had dreamed of having a big name brand that everyone talked about and bought from. I had AI give me a name and logo ideas. Then, I gave up on it because it was, or at least I thought, unrealistic. But, here I am, starting a dropshipping business, completely from scratch for the first time, by myself.

I used my old name, which was Everwear at that time, and logo and tweaked it. The original ideas was simplicity and timelessness. I made designs and put them on my website. A simple one, a completely white shirt, with the infinity logo on the front. Then I realized that timelessness was not a realistic theme and so I wanted to change the name. I had already put out a bunch of products so I didn't want to change the logo. All this thinking took place while the website was blank and in the makeover phase. Then I landed on Flow, simple and memorable.

All of this brings us to now. In the middle of starting the brand and taking off. When choosing this brand, I made sure to use the right printing service to make sure customers had the best experience. I compared and researched about the different brands that have printing services. I also had to make sure the prices were all reasonable. All of these elements made up Flow and all the products you see on the website today.

My goal for Flow is to fulfill my dream and become that brand everyone talks about. I hope that you as the customer, have your expectations met. And obviously, I hope you find what you are looking for.

Best Wishes,

Suryansh - Founder`,
